&quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity 
exercising permissions granted by this License. 

&quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, 
including but not limited to software source code, documentation 
source, and configuration files. 

&quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical 
transformation or translation of a Source form, including but 
not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, 
and conversions to other media types. 

&quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or 
Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a 
copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work 
(an example is provided in the Appendix below). 

&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object 
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the 
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications 
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes 
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain 
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, 
the Work and Derivative Works thereof. 

&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including 
the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions 
to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally 
submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; 
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent 
to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to 
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, 
and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the 
Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but 
excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise 
designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot; 

&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity 
on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and 
subsequently incorporated within the Work. 

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, 
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the 
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. 

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, 
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, 
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable 
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) 
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You 
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work 
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct 
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses 
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate 
as of the date such litigation is filed. 

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the 
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without 
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You 
meet the following conditions: 

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and 

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices 
stating that You changed the files; and 

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works 
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of 
the Derivative Works; and 

(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its 
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must 
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained 
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not 
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one 
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed 
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, 
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided 
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed 
as modifying the License. 

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and 
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions 
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or 
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with 
the conditions stated in this License. 

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, 
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work 
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of 
this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify 
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed 
with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade 
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, 
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or 
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, 
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or 
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions 
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any 
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, 
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a 
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the 
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, 
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor 
has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing 
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, 
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, 
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only 
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf 
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability 
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason 
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

&quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, 
including but not limited to software source code, documentation 
source, and configuration files.

and conversions to other media types. 

&quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or 
Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a 
copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work 
(an example is provided in the Appendix below). 

&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object 
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the 
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications 
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes 
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain 
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, 
the Work and Derivative Works thereof. 

&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including 
the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions 
to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally 
submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner 
or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of 
the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; 
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent 
to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to 
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, 
and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the 
Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but 
excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, 
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the 
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. 

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of 
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, 
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, 
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, 
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable 
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their 
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) 
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You 
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work 
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct 
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses 
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate 
as of the date such litigation is filed. 

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the 
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without 
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You 
meet the following conditions: 

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or 
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and 

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices 
stating that You changed the files; and 

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works 
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and 
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, 
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of 
the Derivative Works; and 

(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its 
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must 
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained 
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not 
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one 
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed 
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, 
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and 
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution 
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside 
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided 
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed 
as modifying the License. 

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and 
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions 
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or 
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, 
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with 
the conditions stated in this License. 

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, 
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work 
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of 
this License, without any additional terms or conditions. 
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify 
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed 
with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade 
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, 
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the 
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or 
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each 
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, 
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or 
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions 
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any 
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, 
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly 
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be 
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a 
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the 
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, 
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor 
has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing 
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, 
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, 
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this 
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only 
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf 
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, 
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability 
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason 
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0 

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC 
LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM 
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

1. DEFINITIONS 

&quot;Contribution&quot; means: 

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation 
distributed under this Agreement, and 
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
i) changes to the Program, and 
ii) additions to the Program; 

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are 
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &#39;originates&#39; 
from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor 
itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&#39;s behalf. Contributions do not 
include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of 
software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own 
license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. 

&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program. 

&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are 
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when 
combined with the Program. 

&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this 
Agreement. 

&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, 
including all Contributors. 

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to 
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly 
perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, 
if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. 
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under 
Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise 
transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and 
object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of 
the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is 
added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such 
combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license 
shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. 
No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. 
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses 
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any 
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other 
intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor 
disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other 
entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or 
otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted 
hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure 
any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a 
third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute 
the Program, it is Recipient&#39;s responsibility to acquire that license 
before distributing the Program. 
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright 
license set forth in this Agreement. 

3. REQUIREMENTS 

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under 
its own license agreement, provided that: 

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and 
b) its license agreement: 
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties 
and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or 
conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or 
conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for 
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and 
consequential damages, such as lost profits; 
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are 
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and 
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable 
manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 

When the Program is made available in source code form: 

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained 
within the Program. 

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, 
if 
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the 
originator of the Contribution. 

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with 
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is 
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who 
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner 
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, 
if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such 
Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify 
every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, 
damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and 
other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified 
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial 
Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial 
product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims 
or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property 
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: 
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and 
b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the 
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement 
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at 
its own expense. 

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product 
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If 
that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers 
warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are 
such Commercial Contributor&#39;s responsibility alone. Under this section, the 
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other 
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a 
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the 
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 

5. NO WARRANTY 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN 
&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, 
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each 
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using 
and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its 
exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the 
risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to 
or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of 
operations. 

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY 
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION 
LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN 
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) 
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE 
EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

7. GENERAL 

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the 
remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the 
parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent 
necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a 
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself 
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) 
infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s rights granted 
under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 

All Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to 
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does 
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of 
such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement terminate, 
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as 
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement 
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue 
and survive. 

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in 
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be 
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to 
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to 
time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this 
Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The 
Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement 
Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will 
be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including 
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the 
Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the 
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program 
(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly 
stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or 
licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, 
whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the 
Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. 

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the 
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this 
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year 
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in 
any resulting litigation.
